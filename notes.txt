Why Golang?
    Simplicity
        25 keywords
        NO classes & Inheritance
            Only Structs (state) & functions (behavior)
            Composition over Inheritance
        Abstractions using Interfaces
            Implicity implementation of interfaces
        NO access control modifiers
        Support of Higher Order Functions
            functions can be assigned to variables
            functions can be passed as arguments to other functions
            functions can be retured as a return value from other function

    Faster execution
    Faster build creation
    No support for dynamic libraries
    Built for concurrency  
        Language Feature
            go, chan, select, range
        Scheduler is built in the runtime
        1000s of goroutines can be executed using 1 thread
